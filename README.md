# Applicant Default Prediction - Documentation part

## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of finance and lending, the accurate prediction of loan defaults is
paramount for effective risk management and decision-making by financial institutions.
Traditional methods are often limited, prompting the need for advanced machine learning
models. The challenge lies in developing a robust predictive model capable of automatically
identifying potential loan defaulters, thereby enabling lenders to proactively manage risks,
minimize financial losses, and make well-informed lending decisions. The project aims to
address this crucial need by leveraging historical loan data and implementing sophisticated
machine learning algorithms to create accurate predictive models for assessing the likelihood
of borrower default.
